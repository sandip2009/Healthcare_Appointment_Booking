# Healthcare Booking API

This is a Laravel 10+ API for managing healthcare professionals, their availability, and patient appointments.  
It supports:

- Managing healthcare professionals with availability schedules (`available_days` JSON config).
- Generating booking slots dynamically based on working hours and appointments.
- Avoiding double-booking by marking overlapping slots as unavailable.
- Returning slot availability per day or only for the current date.
